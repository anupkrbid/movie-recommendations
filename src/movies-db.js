Open Hearts pulls back the curtain on everything from logistical coordination to the symphony of open heart surgery, revealing a detailed world that few outside of the profession ever get to see. But when complications arise the abilities of these medical professionals are put to the test. This renewed approach to global partnership has transformed pediatric cardiac care in Haiti by helping to train its first pediatric cardiologist, and enabling St. Damien to become the first hospital in Haiti capable of treating children with heart disease. "Charity" must change, and this striking example of humanity and excellence draws you in while challenging what it looks like to lend a hand.'
